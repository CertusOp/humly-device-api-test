# Humly device API testing page

index.html page is used to test device API functionality when this page is displayed in URL signage mode. Through this page user should be able to read and change LED's color. Functionality for reading device settings is also implemented. Changing device settings is only limited to changing time zone.

ðŸ‘‰ **Important!** In URL signage mode you should not use Device API to change time zone. Device time zone should be configured through settings on Humly Control Panel.
